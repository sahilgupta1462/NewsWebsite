U.S. News may change, suspend or discontinue any or all of the U.S. News Services at any time.

In the event of a conflict between any provision of these Terms and Conditions, on the one hand, and any specific terms and conditions for a particular U.S. News Service, on the other hand, the applicable provision of the specific terms and conditions for that U.S. News Service shall prevail with respect to your use of the U.S. News Services.</p>
